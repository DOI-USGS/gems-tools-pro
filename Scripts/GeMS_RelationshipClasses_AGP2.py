# script to create relationship classes in a GeMS database
#
# Somebody who uses relationship classes more than I should look at this.
# Particularly, are the Forward and Backward labels named as usefully as possible?
# Are there other issues? 
#
# Note that Validate Database script can be used to maintain referential integrity, 
# thus I don't suggest use of relationship classes to accomplish this.
#   Ralph Haugerud, USGS
# Use this mostly in order to see related records in Identify tool in ArcMap or in
# the feature attribute pop-up in ArcGIS Pro. Note that the related table must in the map
# in order for the related records to be displayed
#   Evan Thoms, USGS
# GeMS_RelationshipClasses_AGP2.py
# 6 June 2019: updated to work with Python 3 in ArcGIS Pro. Evan Thoms
#   ran the script through 2to3. No other edits necessary
#   renamed from GeMS_RelationshipClasses1_Arc10.py to GeMS_RelationshipClasses_AGP2.py
# 7 November 2019: In response to issue raised at repo, completely rewritten to 
#   1) not create feature dataset just for the relationship classes. Found the 
#      feature dataset could be written, but could not write relationship classes there.
#      Perhaps because it only had a name and no other properties, although this is probably 
#      not best practices anyway. Relationship classes are now written in the workspace 
#      in which the feature class is found
#   2) create relationship classes based on controlled fields, not a list of explicit
#      relationship classes. Could result in many superfluous relationship classes
#   3) attempt to work with table and field names regardless of case
