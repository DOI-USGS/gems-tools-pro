# Jupyter Notebooks for GeMS

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks to work with and understand the GeMS schema. 

You can read each one here on GitHub as static documentation or you can download them to use on your computer with your data. To download all of the notebooks at once in a zip file, go to the green code button above and choose 'Download ZIP'.

To download just one notebook at a time, click on the one you want, choose 'Raw' from the banner above the contents of the file, and use the 'Save as' command from your browser to save the file with an .ipynb extension.
